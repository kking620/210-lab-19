Dune
This movie was absolutely breathtaking.
I thought the actors did an amazing job.
The setting was incredible.

Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith
While not the best, still highly enjoyable.
It is my favorite Star Wars movie.
I love the dynamic between the two leads.

Saw
A great start to a series.
It was very disturbing, but in a fun way.
I saw the ending coming a mile away.

Avatar
Too long in my opinion.
The CGI was incredible.
I cannot wait for the sequels.
